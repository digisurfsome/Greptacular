# Quality Requirements


<div class="formalpara-title">

**Content**

</div>

This section contains all relevant quality requirements.

The most important of these requirements have already been described in
section 1.2. (quality goals), therefore they should only be referenced
here. In this section 10 you should also capture quality requirements
with lesser importance, which will not create high risks when they are
not fully achieved (but might be *nice-to-have*).

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Motivation**

</div>

Since quality requirements will have a lot of influence on architectural
decisions you should know what qualities are really important for your
stakeholders, in a specific and measurable way.

- See [Quality Requirements](https://docs.arc42.org/section-10/) in the
  arc42 documentation.

- See the extensive [Q42 quality model on
  https://quality.arc42.org](https://quality.arc42.org).

## Quality Requirements Overview

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Content**

</div>

An overview or summary of quality requirements.

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Motivation**

</div>

Often we encounter dozens (or even hundreds) of detailed quality
requirements. In this overview section you should try to summarize, e.g.
by describing categories or topics (as suggested by [ISO
25010:2023](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:25010:ed-2:v1:en)
or [Q42](https://quality.arc42.org))

If these summary descriptions are already precise, specific enough and
measurable, you may skip section 10.2.

**Form**

</div>

Use a simple table in which each line contains a category or topic and a
short description of the quality requirement. Alternatively, you may use
a mindmap to structure these quality requirements. In literature, the
idea of a *quality attribute tree* has also been described, which puts
the generic term "quality" as the root and uses a tree-like refinement
of the term "quality". \[Bass+21\] introduced the term "Quality
Attribute Utility Tree" for this purpose.

## Quality Scenarios

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Content**

</div>

Quality scenarios make quality requirements concrete and allow to decide
whether they are fulfilled (in the sense of acceptance criteria). Ensure
that your scenarios are specific and measurable.

Two kinds of scenarios are especially useful:

- *Usage scenarios* (also called application scenarios or use case
  scenarios) describe the system’s runtime reaction to a certain
  stimulus. This also includes scenarios that describe the system’s
  efficiency or performance. Example: The system reacts to a user’s
  request within one second.

- *Change scenarios* describe the desired effect of a modification or
  extension of the system or of its immediate environment. Example:
  Additional functionality is implemented or requirements for a quality
  attribute change, and the effort or duration of the change is
  measured.

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Form**

</div>

Typical information for detailed scenarios include the following:

In short form (favoured in the Q42 model):

- **Context/Background**: What kind of system or component, what is the
  envirionment or situation?

- **Source/Stimulus**: Who or what initiates or triggers a behaviour,
  reaction or action.

- **Metric/Acceptance Criteria**: A response including a *measure* or
  *metric*

The long form of scenarios (favoured by the SEI and \[Bass+21\]) is more
detailed and includes the following information:

- **Scenario ID**: A unique identifier for the scenario.

- **Scenario Name**: A short, descriptive name for the scenario.

- **Source**: The entity (user, system, or event) that initiates the
  scenario.

- **Stimulus**: The triggering event or condition the system must
  address.

- **Environment**: The operational context or condition under which the
  system experiences the stimulus.

- **Artifact**: The building-blocks or other elements of the system
  affected by the stimulus.

- **Response**: The outcome or behavior the system exhibits in reaction
  to the stimulus.

- **Response Measure**: The criteria or metric by which the system’s
  response is evaluated.
